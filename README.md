## 👋 Hi, I’m Lani!

I’m a Software Engineer with a foundation in full-stack development (**React, Python, SQL**) and over five years of experience supporting and improving SaaS platforms in fast-paced, customer-focused environments.

## 🧩 About Me

My background combines formal engineering training with hands-on experience working in live production systems. Before moving into software engineering, I worked as a **Senior Technical Support Specialist and Team Lead**, where I handled complex Tier 2–3 issues, reproduced bugs, investigated root causes, and worked closely with Engineering, QA, and Product teams to resolve platform issues and improve overall system performance.

That experience directly influences how I build software today. I think about how systems behave in real-world use, how users experience the product, and how teams maintain and support what gets shipped. I’m particularly strong at troubleshooting, understanding system behavior across the stack, and turning messy problems into clear, actionable solutions.
